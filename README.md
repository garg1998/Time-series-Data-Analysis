# Time-series-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis of Time series data as a part of FlexGen Intern Position 


# Task
Perform data evaluation and preparation for analysis, and conduct analysis of temperature for the presented dataset. More specifically, one needs to
-	Perform exploratory data analysis (your preferable tool, Excel or Jupyter)
-	Build graphical representations of the analyzing dataset: weekly (min, max, avg)
-	Identify annual monthly seasonality and trends of the presented temperature observations based on average temperature
-	Identify correlation between weekly average temperature and precipitation

# Data
There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with weather/temperature data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively. The data for each city have been concatenated along with a city column indicating the source: sj for San Juan and iq for Iquitos. Throughout the dataset, missing values have been filled as NaNs.
Dataset can be downloaded from the following link.
Climate data weather station measurements:
city – Temperature observations locations
year – Year of the temperature observation
weekofyear – Week of year of the temperature observation
week_start_date – Data of a week start of the temperature observation
station_max_temp_c – Maximum temperature
station_min_temp_c – Minimum temperature
station_avg_temp_c – Average temperature
station_precip_mm – Total precipitation
station_diur_temp_rng_c – Diurnal temperature range
